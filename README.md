# Idea
A software development and system analysis company requests the preparation of a program to test the speed of its employees, to transfer them to departments that need a fast typing speed.

Therefore, this program was designed. it requires entering the employeeâ€™s number and choosing the level of the test, and they will be able to know the number of words they will write per minute, if their speed continues in this way, as well as the points they obtained and the time taken to perform the test.

And to facilitate the manager, they can know the fastest employees through the dashboard, which includes the employee's number and the total points they obtained from previous tests.
