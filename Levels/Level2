Last week, the USS George Washington visited the port city of Busan, 
South Korea as part of the US involvement in local war games exercises.
With a crew of almost 6300 people, this enormous aircraft carrier is like a floating city.
From front to back, the ship is almost 340 meters long , 78 m wide and 77 m in height.
